# K-OS

A simple operating system for educational purposes.

I'm currently following the book, [*Writing a Simple Operating System from Scratch* by Nick Blundell](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf).

## Building

Before building, view [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites).

1. Run `make` in the source directory (`/`).
    * Files should be located in the `/build` directory.

### Prerequisites

* A UNIX-like environment,
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/),
* [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) (an assembler), and
* [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) (a machine emulator).

## Executing

1. Enter `make em` in the command-line.
